#📖 Blog Website – Day 2 of 30 Days Coding Challenge

#This project is part of my 30-Day Coding Challenge, where I build one project every day to improve my development skills.

#🌟 About the Project

#On Day 2, I created a responsive blog website with:

Dark + green theme (same as my portfolio)

Search and filter functionality for blog posts

Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

Clean and professional UI design

The blog currently features About Me details taken directly from my portfolio and will be expanded with more posts in the future.

#👥 Collaboration

This challenge is something I’m doing together with my coding partner Swara.
We’re pushing each other to stay consistent and level up our skills day by day 🚀.

📅 Challenge

This is Day 2 of 30 in the challenge. Excited to keep building and sharing my progress!
